# immunizationaggregate
## Project aims at aggregating and mapping data for child immunization in a given Org Unit.

Data on the above indicator is collected using manual paper forms which are then
submitted to the county for the entries to be made on excel spread-sheets there 
after discussed at the CHMT level. 
This double entry process makes the data prone to errors and inconsistency.
When the county stakeholders use the extracted data they end up deducing 
inaccurate conclusions from the report collected on the county population.
There is a need to build a minimum viable solution for the Community 
health workers involved in data collection. This will ensure accuracy 
when mapping data for children for immunization. Keep in mind that 
data collection areas are resource constrained and majority of the 
health officers involved are volunteers who may only be willing to 
incur as minimal cost as possible.
